# LoA Scheduling System
### Note: This isn't an officially-endorsed project by Lyceum. It's a C# WinFormApps-based system designed for a SAUD group project.
Initial commit focuses on basic functionality and a simple but presentable UI design. Certain aspects of the project rely on external NuGet packages & extensions to upkeep the program's visual appeal. With that said, don't just copy-paste the code and expect it to work - you might end up missing a lot of packages.

This project is open-source for any aspiring Teknolohistas wanting to study the code and possibly make something out of what they learned. 
Copying code with the purpose of disecting it and analysing it thoroughly is one thing, copying it just to copy it is another - don't just steal code.
You'll never learn that way, but the former is the best way to learn.
